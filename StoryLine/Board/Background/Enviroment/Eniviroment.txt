The police are only able to go in and out of rich zone. The transportation was thru cannon that would throw them across the huge wall, which could say went all they way up to sky.

Rich
_____________________________________________________________________________
This would be intro zone where the character is woken up, or created in a lab.This would be more of a hub for people that extreamly rich crime rate is extreamly low(or is it)

This imo would be the intro zone and final zone. As it would show how the crime is in hidden, and even worse is covered up every crime is covered up, shows a kind of race system no based on color but on social status.

Map Size: small

Consist of few houses, the poor try to come into zone and kill them, so they can activate a lottery system. 

Seprated by lane of factories, the access to the middle is easy from pool.

Poor
_____________________________________________________________________________


This area consists most of the population everthing is automated causing the middle class to be select few and are given to people in a form of a lottery system. 

Most of the people are "crimnals" they want to kill the middle class so the lottery reset causing random people to go up in middle class. 

Crimes are commited constantly, heavy police is deployed, but isnt enough. People survive from stealing from food pill that they get daily but is stolen and traded for items such as clothes.
