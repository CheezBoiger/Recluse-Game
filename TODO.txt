Vulkan:
  Vulkan RHI is almost done, we need to extract signal semaphores from submitSwapchainCmdBuffers
  to allow renderer to define them instead. 

  Compute CommandBuffers need their own create function.

  Need to set up Rebuilding of Swapchain and framebuffers, as well as cmdbuffers if window resizes.

Renderer:

  Start defining upper level CmdList, which is what the scene graph will degrade to. For
  CmdList extraction, we will be reading and loading onto gpu friendly commandbuffers. This
  needs to be multithreaded.

  Light definitions are needed. Light probes needed, implementing spherical harmonics.

  Need to define our skybox and day/night cycles. This will require a separate pipeline
  RenderPass.

  Current Rendering Pipeline:
  Rendering Technique: Clustered Forward (deferred if we are adding gbuffers, optional).
    - Pre process: Light Culling process.
      Input: 
      Output: light grid shader storage buffer.
    - Process: Clustered Forward PBR Rendering 
      Input: (Any gbuffers needed?)
              lightGrid shader storage buffer.
      Output: 1 RenderTexture
    - Post Process: 
      Input: 1 RenderTexture
      Output: FinalTexture
